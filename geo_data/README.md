# Geo Data

This directory is used to store the data for city geometry, which was used to create a "whitebox" render of the buildings/map. It's a legacy part of the application and workflow, but is kept for historical reasons.

## Overview

The NYC 3D Model by Community District is a publicly available model consisting of every building in New York City present in 2014. The model is based on DOITT’s 2014 aerial survey, which provides roof structure details, including a high-level of detail for certain iconic buildings. The Department of City Planning imported and enhanced the DOITT files by converting the entire model into .3dm format, which is compatible with Rhinoceros 3D modeling software. DCP also divided the model into the City’s 59 Community Districts and enriched each CD with base layers, including lots, streets, parks, and rail lines.
