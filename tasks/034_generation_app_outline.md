# Generation app outline

I want to add the outline of the NYC map that's used in the `src/isometric_nyc/generation/debug_map.py` app and add it to the generation app (app.py and static/viewer.js)

We should add a toggle to the frontend that turns on/off this outline, which should be rendered over the quadrants given their lat/lng geometry.
